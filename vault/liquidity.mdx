In Beliquid, the liquidity in the orderbook is provided by the assets deposited by users in the vaults. Currently, Beliquid team runs market making algorithms on top of vaults to earn APR for the users. However, in the future, creators of vaults will be able to run their own market making algorithms for providing orderbook liquidity and earning APR.
