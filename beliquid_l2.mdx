BeLiquid is a high-performance Layer 2 solution built on Berachain, featuring an on-chain orderbook for perpetual futures and spot trading. Unlike traditional centralized exchanges where profits flow to exchanges and market makers, BeLiquid democratizes trading profits by returning them to the community through liquidity pools. Projects and community members can provide liquidity similar to Uniswap or Aerodrome, while sophisticated market-making algorithms ensure efficient trading execution.

At its core, BeLiquid's architecture is optimized for speed, leveraging a custom orderbook layer that processes over 100,000 transactions per second with 100ms finality. The system uses a proprietary "Honeycomb" script for state transitions, while deriving its security from Berachain's validators. All transactions, including order matches, deposits, and withdrawals, are recorded on the blockchain with state roots batched to Berachain L1, ensuring both performance and security.
